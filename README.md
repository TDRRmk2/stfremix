# Sonic the Fighters: Remix
StF:Remix is a hack of the original arcade version of Sonic the Fighters, including some new features to help give the game a new spin.

## Features
* **Honey, Dr. Eggman (mech form) and Metal Sonic have all been added to the CSS**: They're in invisible slots to the right of Knuckles, and can be picked normally.
* **Restored random mode**: Hold P1 or P2 punch while pressing start on the title screen, to play random mode. You'll be given a randomized set of characters to fight against in story mode, without repeats, including the following extra characters: Honey, mechless Eggman, RoboEgg, Metal Sonic and Super Sonic.
* **Remix alt mode**: Hold P1 or P2 kick while pressing start on the title screen, to enable remix mode. Currently just cute costume swaps for normal color Amy and Honey, with possibly more costumes to be added or maybe even gameplay changes in the future.

## TODO
Add the rest of this document! :p (explaining install, more known issues, and probably more)

Note, this disasm hasn't been tested with the official Intel assembler, and I'm only using the included `binutils` in the `GNU/` directory of this repository.
